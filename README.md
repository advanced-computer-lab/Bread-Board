# Airline Reservation System.

## Motivation

In travel industry, Flight Reservation systems are crucial to help book flights online for particular seats available from various flights and increase revenue, and to easy the process of reserving a flight ticket online in a very simple way.
Build Status

The project is up, running and fully functioning, ready for users to reserve flights.
Features

This project is supervised by Dr. Mervat Abo El-Kheir at The German University in Cairo. To start off, this is a modified implementation of an airline reservation system, adding new features while keeping a really simple UI, so that the user can easily navigate throught it and use it without affecting the experience making it a more compact and efficient code.
Tech

    [React]
    [HTML]
    [CSS]
    [JavaScript]
    [Axios]
    [jsonwebtoken]
    [mongoose]
    [react-bootstrap]
    [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
    node.js - evented I/O for the backend
    Express - fast node.js network app framework @tjholowaychuk
    jQuery - duh

## How To Use

> > User can choose number of adults, number of children, departure and arrival airports and dates and choose cabin seats, for example, 2 adults, 2 children, departure airport is BER and arrival airport is CAI, departure date is 7/12/2021 and arrival date is 10/12/2021, and finally choose business seats.
> > Either the user signs in if the user already has an account, sign up if the user does not have an existing account, or just sign in as a guest user. Guest users can only place a ticket reservation right away, while users can have their personal information stored,updated or deleted, view their reserved flights which are returned as a list of flight or just simply make a new ticket reservation.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

_Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!_

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
